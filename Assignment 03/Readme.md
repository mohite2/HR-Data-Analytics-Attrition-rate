### The purpose of this assignment is to get you comfortable thinking in the RGB color space.

### Task :Pick 3 of your own images (from the web, from your own photos) and create a visualization that shows how similar/different these images are using these histogramming methods presented in class.

You are free to choose 3 images that look "similar" to you or very different and describe how mapping them into color space either confirms or negates these differences or similarities.  (For example, let's say you choose a painting of a beach and a photo of a beach their color spaces might look very different although they are representations of similar objects). You may also want to choose a set of images that you like and those you don't like to see if there are any differences due to color choices.
 
 Answer the following prompt in a few sentences (3-5 sentences is fine): 

Both of the color re-mappings presented in this notebook are not perfect.  What are some issues you can think of in how color is rebinned from a full color image into an image with less colors with the functions provided?
