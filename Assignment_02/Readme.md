## The purpose of this assignment is to get some practice using Pandas to filter and aggregate data and use the outputs of these processes in plots.
### Using one of the tools that we have discussed (matplotlib and/or pandas), construct a visualization of the Illinois Building Inventory that communicates the following information -- choose 3 out of the 4 listed below to visualize:

1. Relationship between the year acquired and the year constructed
2. Total square footage as a function of congressional district ("Congress Dist")
3. Average square footage per floor as a function of congressional district
5. Square footage for the five most common departments (aka "Agency Name") as a function of year.  Here "most common" refers to the departments with the most entries in the table.  6. You can choose year acquired or year constructed (or some sort of average of the two!), just make sure you state which you chose and why.
